General Information
=====

In order for this library to work you need to connect your oscilloscope to your device via USB. This can be done either by USB to USB or by a GPIB to USB converter. /n
 `PyVisa <https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>` needs to be properly installed on the device and in case your device doesn't properly recognise the oscilloscope or the GPIB to USB converter, you need to download or create a fitting driver on the  `National Instruments website. <https://www.ni.com/>`
