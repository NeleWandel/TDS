General Information
===================

In order for this library to work you need to connect your oscilloscope to your device via USB. 
This can be done either via a USB to USB connection or with a GPIB to USB converter.
Please make sure that `PyVisa <https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>` is properly installed on the device and 
in case your device doesn't recognise the oscilloscope or the GPIB to USB converter, 
you need to download or create a fitting driver on the  `National Instruments website <https://www.ni.com/>`.
