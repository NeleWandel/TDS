Welcome to the Tektronix TDS7404B Digital Phosphor Oscilloscope Python Documentation
===================================

With this library you will be able to control your Tektronix Oscilloscope via Python. This allows for easy automation of the oscilloscope.
While this project was optimised for the *TDS7404B* it should work with every oscilloscope of the TDS7000 and TDS7000B series as well as with every communication signal analyzer of the CSA7000 series.

.. note::
   This library is fully based on `PyVisa <https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ so please make sure to properly install PyVisa to your device before using this library.

Please take a look at :doc:`General Information` for further information about setting up the devices and library.
You can find an overview of all valid commands and their variables in :doc:`API` .
