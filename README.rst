Tektronix TDS7404B Documentation
=================================

This is a university project. The goal of the project was to write a library of Phython commands that can be used to operate the Tektronix TDS7404B Oscilloscope.
This repository includes all data that was needed to write the tds.readthedocs.io website. 
It also includes the Python code in main.


  The official read the docs GitHub template was used for creating this repository.
  More info about that can be found here: https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/


  For the documentation of the commands the Tektronix online programmer manual was used and on some occasions quoted.
